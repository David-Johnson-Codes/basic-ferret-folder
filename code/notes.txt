What does it take to take care of a ferret?

First off, it's great you are taking the time to research ferrets as pets. They are playful, have individual personalities, 
are socialble and just plain out fun to watch. Ferrets sometimes get a bad rap, people will often say they smell. It's true that
they stinkier compared to dogs and cats, but with proper care, that can be mitigated. 

Although ferrets are small pets, they are much different than rats, hamsters and other rodents. Ferrets are in the familia mustilea,
and not to be confused with rodents. Ferrets need plenty of "play" time and should not be kept in cages for the entire day. 

Here I'll go through each main concern every new ferret owner should have.
